Oski Rescue is a web app that utilizes the Google Maps API to create a simple but effective way to view emergency resources on and around the UC Berkeley Campus. This is accomplished by combining JavaScript & TypeScript functionality with information sourced online to pinpoint Blue Light Emergency Telephones.
